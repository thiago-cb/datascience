- **Objective**: To create a spam filter that classifies new SMS messages as spam or non-spam.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
- **Solution**: Used **Conditional Probability** concepts to build a function that works like the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm.
- **Key Achievement**: Managed to build a spam filter for SMS messages with an **accuracy** of **98.74%** on the test set.
