    - **Objective**: To create a spam filter that classifies new SMS messages as spam or non-spam.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
    - **Solution**: Used **Conditional Probability** concepts to build a function that works like the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm.
    - **Key Achievement**: Managed to build a spam filter for SMS messages with an **accuracy** of **98.74%** on the test set.

    - **Objective**: To find out the best markets to advertise programming courses.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
    - **Solution**: Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Data Cleaning/Wrangling** and **Data Visualisation** techniques.
    - **Key Achievement**: Found **the US** as the **best** market to advertise in.

- ### [Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](https://github.com/thiago-cb/datascience/blob/master/Probability%20and%20Statistics/Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings/Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb)
    - **Objective**: To find any difference between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and 2016.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
    - **Solution**: Performed **Descriptive Statistical Analysis** and **Data Visualisation** techniques.
    - **Key Achievement**: On **average**, popular movies released in 2016 were rated **lower** on Fandango than popular movies released in 2015.

- ### [Mobile App for Lottery Addiction](https://github.com/thiago-cb/datascience/blob/master/Probability%20and%20Statistics/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction.ipynb)
    - **Objective**:To practise applying probability and combinatorics concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
    - **Solution**: Built functions that calculate **Factorials**, **Combinations** and **Probabilities**.
    - **Key Achievement**: Managed to write functions that calculate the **probabilities of winning** any prize with one or more tickets besides checking historical lottery data.
