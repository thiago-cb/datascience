    "# Exploring Hackers News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll compare two different types of posts from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either *Ask HN* or *Show HN*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit *Ask HN* posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as \"What is the best online course you've ever taken?\" Likewise, users submit *Show HN* posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do *Ask HN* or *Show HN* receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the dataset we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampled from the remaining submissions."

Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, Ask HN posts received more comments on average and Ask HN posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (20:00 - 21:00 GMT) received the most comments on average."
