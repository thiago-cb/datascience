- ### [Building A Handwritten Digits Classifier](https://github.com/thiago-cb/datascience/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Building%20A%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier/Building%20A%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier.ipynb)
    - **Objective**: To explore the effectiveness of **deep**, **feedforward neural networks** in image classification.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
    - **Solution**: Applied **Neural Networks** with different hidden layers and numbers of neurons.
    - **Key Achievement**: Found that using more hidden layers **increase** the amount of **overfitting**.
