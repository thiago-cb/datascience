## [Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/thiago-cb/datascience/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals.ipynb)
- **Objective**: To create different machine learning models and evaluate their performances.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
- **Solution**: Applied **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms using their default settings and **RMSE** as the error metric.
- **Key Achievement**: Obtained the **best accuracy** when using the **Random Forest** model.
